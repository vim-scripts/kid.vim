Kid (http://kid.lesscode.org/) is a attribute-based xml templating language written in Python. This syntax file covers the language as documented in the language specification. The gzipped tarball also contains a kid ftplugin, for gvim integration and a kid ftdetect plugin so that vim highlights the file as kid rather than xml/xhtml.
